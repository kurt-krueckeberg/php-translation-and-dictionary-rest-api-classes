- The 'headword' should be compared with the input word. If the same then it is not a phrase or expression. Therefore scan all the results first for those where:

  $r->headword == $word

- Next put output where 

  $r->headword == $word && isset($r->pos)

  - The 'pos' can be missing

- Then output based on the class styles in the words.
