Yandex Translation and Dictinary REST API
=========================================

## Translator

Requires Yandex Cloud account:

- My cloud account name: cloud-XXXXX

- Services: AI Service -> Translate

- Translate [documentation](https://cloud.yandex.com/en/docs/translate/)

## Dictionary

- Yandex

Their [Dictionary API](https://yandex.com/dev/dictionary/) offers ???#er??? requests per ???month. They also offer a translation service, which seems to require a separate key from the dictionary key?

The Yandex Tranalte is part of their cloud offering.But since they are a Russian company, current sanctions seem to prevent paying for their cloud translation service.

 Is the dictonary lookup, too?
