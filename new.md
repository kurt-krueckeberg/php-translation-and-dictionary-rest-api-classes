**Unit 4 Die Welle Vocabulary and Grammar Curriculum Summary**
==============================================================

Vocabulary Summary
------------------

You will need to know approximately 50 film vocabulary words. At the
beginning of the unit, you will only need to recognize these words, and
know their genders and plural forms. By the end of the unit, you will
need to be able to recall them in the context of the film. You will be
given fill-in-the-blank sentences taken directly from the film. You will
need to recall what vocabulary word fits in the blank. These sentences
are listed with the corresponding vocabulary word at the end of this
document.
