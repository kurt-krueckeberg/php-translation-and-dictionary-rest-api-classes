## Get Big Picture

### Understand Translation Service Requirements

How to the use of these "inputs" differnt per service? Do some require authenication using headers and other query parameter? 
Therefore we first must descibe how the passes the 'inputs' REST-fully -- via headers, query parameters, which query paramters does each service
have in commoon or not in common?

This will give us the big-picture and suggest how to define the xml, and it will help us apply good implmentation design patterns. Possible design patterns are:

- Factory Pattern

- Template Pattern

- Strategy Pattern

### Understand How XML Works

- [XML Tutorial](https://www.w3schools.com/xml/)

We want I want the xml elemtnst to reflect the program requirements. What does it translation service need: authenticationd key, endpoint, query parameters.
Should query parameters have two child elements, <parm_name> and <parm_value>, the later of which can be empty?  
The reason is, the 'microsoft' service has an 'api_version' query paramter, but we always use a fixed value of '3.0' for it.
