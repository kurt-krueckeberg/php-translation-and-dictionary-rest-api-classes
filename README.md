# PHP Translation and Dictionary REST API Classes

This code requires PHP 8.1 because it uses:

- Enumerations (that also implement an interface)

- readonly class properties (that are defined and promoted to class members on the constructor).

- `new` expressions in class constructors (to create objects as default constructor parameters).
